I am a biostatistician at Center for Preventive Ophthalmology and Biostatistics, University of Pennsylvania.I am currently working on several ophthalmic clinical studies and clinical trials and studies such as the Fluoreomethlone as Adjunctive Medical Therapy for TT Surgery [(FLAME)](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04149210), the study of Analyzing Retinal Microanatomy in Retinopathy of Prematurity to Improve Care [(BABY-STEPS)](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04995341), and the Primary Open-Angle African Ancestry Glaucoma Genetics [(POAAGG)](https://www.med.upenn.edu/joanobrienlab/poaagg-study.html) study.

I received M.S. in Biostatistics from Columbia University, where I provided statistical support for a NIH-funded trial, [ROKHyT](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03515681), working with Professor [JLP Thompson](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/jlt12) and [Steven Shea MD](https://www.genmed.columbia.edu/research-labs/steven-shea-md-ms). From 2014 to 2019, I studied pharmaceutical science at the [China Pharmaceutical University](https://en.cpu.edu.cn/), China.
